It is a natural leader and a proactive force. The number 1 represents newness, movement, and the possibilities that await us. In spiritual symbolism, it is the number of creation and the birth of all things here",
     strength:" 1 is Independent Of all the numbers in Numerology, the 1 is the most self-sufficient, needing nothing but itself and its energy to thrive. It doesn't sit around waiting for opportunities to come about, it makes its own luck by capitalizing on circumstances others may be afraid to explore. The single-digit number 1 doesn't want to waste any time getting stuck negotiating or discussing plans. Going it alone allows for greater flexibility and quick, efficient movement.",
     weakness:"While this number can come across as ambitious, its stop-at-nothing attitude can also make it seem uncaring or domineering as it pushes its way forward. More physical than spiritual, it doesn't need anyone else's help and is too focused on its own pursuits to even realize when it's made an offense. Softer energies of cooperation and patience get shoved aside in the interest of movement and progress. The number 1 would call itself fearless, but a lack of foresight can all-too-easily lead it into trouble that could have been avoided. Tunnel vision and an extreme sense of invincibility makes the 1 so focused on the path before it that it can miss the warning signs in its peripheral vision." ,

It is able to sense currents and feelings instinctively, then use these clues to connect with others empathically.',
    strength:"The 2 is very Intutive On a very deep and subconscious level, this number can pick up on energies that cannot be seen, only felt. This trait allows the number 2 to be instinctually aware of feelings, thoughts, hopes, and fears others haven't even expressed, then use them as opportunities to offer support and compassion to the partnership.",

The number 5 is an explorer and knows that one of the best ways to experience the world is to interact with the people in it. ",
    weakness:" An uncontrollable need for freedom and constant change makes the number 5 very non-committal. To the 5, committing means being bored and tied down, which goes against everything it stands for.

It is an analytical number that enjoys gathering and filtering through information to find answers.",

Whether it's practical or metaphysical doesn't matter, the number 7 always wants to know more.

While religion is too limiting for this boundless number, a very personal, intellectual connection to the spiritual world gives its experiences more mystery and meaning.",

They are intrinsically able to connect with others in a sensitive and vulnerable way. With great wells of insight into their own behaviors and motivations, they can more easily perceive the world from a heartfelt, spiritual or compassionate way. However, because they are so aware of their feelings, they can end up becoming overly emotional, lacking logic or practicality to proceed.",

With a lust for life, they pursue expansion, rather than wanting to be rooted to one plan forever. As visionaries and free spirits, they are eager to explore and are often quite social.

We can counteract fast fluctuations in lunar energy by taking note of the phase of the moon every Monday.

In a way, Wednesday is the vital communications link to all other days – it’s like the network server of the week (to use computer terms).  Best tasks for Wednesdays:  Communication of course!  Catch up on emails, thank you notes, letters, phone calls, etc.  Wednesday is a good day to sign contracts (that is, if Mercury is not in a retrograde) too.
